                    Mary Review is a magazine of news and ideas written and produced entirely by women. Our goal was to
                    bring parity to the wider journalistic conversation. Initially funded by Kickstarter, Mary grew from
                    print and online content to events and fundraisers supporting women's rights affected by the
                    political climate. As Design Director, I was responsible for the identity, print edition, website,
                    editorial art direction, fundraising decks, marketing collateral, and overall brand aesthetic. In
                    2016, our website was selected for permanent inclusion in the Library of Congress Web Archives.

                    for children. It was founded by Rihanna in honor of her grandparents.<br /><br />

                    In 2017, our team worked on repositioning the non-profit as a strategic organization with roots and
                    momentum. We proposed ways in which the CLF team could engage Rihanna's fan base, and redesigned
                    their website to foster engagement and individual donations. Our studio team shot 360 video footage
                    and photography with Roc Nation in Malawi. As Art Director, I led the rebrand of the CLF identity,
                    proposing a dynamic logo and visual system that mirrored the youthful energy of the children
                    supported by the foundation.

                    Marriott Hotels repositioned themselves as an innovative travel company and launched a multi-channel
                    campaign to communicate their new POV. We were tasked with creating a responsive website that could
                    communicate their new brand positioning with content that can be repurposed and distributed
                    throughout their digital ecosystem.<br /><br />

                    We developed Marriott Magazine—a quarterly digital magazine catered to the modern traveler. We
                    leveraged Marriott's brand recognition to book interviews with well-known people like Neil DeGrasse
                    Tyson, and integrated quality video and photography assets by collaborating with existing partners
                    TED and VSCO. The Wordpress-based solution was designed as a modular system of templates to maximize
                    flexibility of content within their budget. Our team also found unique ways to integrate booking
                    flows within each article type. As Art Director, I oversaw the design of the platform from concept
                    to production.

                    North is a location-based mobile app that helps you discover meaningful places in nature through the
                    stories of others. By aggregating locations and personal experiences from its users, North creates a
                    curated database of places in nature from around the world. While we often fault the digital world
                    for our lack of engagement with the outdoors, North explores how technology can be used to bring us
                    closer to nature.

                    This concept project was developed over one year and is comprised of a business plan, identity and
                    visual design, experience design, pitch book, marketing materials, video, and a public pitch
                    presentation as thesis requirements of the MFA Design Entrepreneurship program at the School of
                    Visual Arts.
